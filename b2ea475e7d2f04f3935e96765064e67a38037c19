      "message": "Thank you for your clear statement.\n\nI\u0027m running this on my daily driver without any problems and haven\u0027t noticed any lack of functionality compared to the datum.\n* The izat/com.qualcomm.location services are not used in FP3 LOS so far, so their remnants only take up space and battery, but IMHO don\u0027t provide any user functionality,\n* I and other users here haven\u0027t found any missing LOS functionality by removing the other apks. So they also seem to only take up space and battery.\nIn addition, I consider any unused/unnecessary blob to be an avoidable security risk. \n\nThus, I am happy to do some more dedicated testing, as our daily usage may not make use of all the features you consider affected, but I would need your guidance on what to check specifically here and on the datum. Alternatively, if you insist, I am certainly also happy to abandon the commit without further efforts.",
