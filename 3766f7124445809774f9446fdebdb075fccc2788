Please reconsider!\n\n/a/ I expect that it will raise privacy concerns as \"Qualcomm Location Service periodically sends us a unique software ID, the location of your device (longitude, latitude and altitude, and its uncertainty) and nearby cellular towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, signal strength, and time (collectively, “Location Data”). As with any Internet communication, we also receive the IP address your device uses.\" (see https://www.qualcomm.com/site/privacy/services)\n\n/b/ It may interfere with UnifiedNlp. IF you consider the QC location service as vital, please check thoughly that UnifiedNlp / MicroG continues to work.",
