      "message": "Is com.qualcomm.location(.XT) really needed? Please reconsider!\n\n/a/ I expect that it will raise privacy concerns as \"Qualcomm Location Service periodically sends us a unique software ID, the location of your device (longitude, latitude and altitude, and its uncertainty) and nearby cellular towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, signal strength, and time (collectively, “Location Data”). As with any Internet communication, we also receive the IP address your device uses.\" (see https://www.qualcomm.com/site/privacy/services)\n\n/b/ It may interfere with UnifiedNlp. IF you consider the QC location service as vital, please check thoughly that UnifiedNlp / MicroG continues to work.",

      "message": "Hmm, as LOS aims to be as FOSS as possible, shouldn\u0027t your strategy be the other way around, i.e. including binary blobs only if they turned out to be unavoidable? So far, these binary blobs were not required and if no new vital need arose, I still recommend to skip them. However, I fully respect that the final decision is with you and dk1978, and I won\u0027t post any further comments here.",
